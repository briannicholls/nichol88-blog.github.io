In 2017, I was working with a friend to grow a delivery-based business. As we grew, our needs changed, and it became difficult to manage a large team of 20-30 people. One of our most commonly used tools was Google Drive and the Google Suite. We started to use things like Google sheets and Forms to keep track of things like Inventory, Accounting, and Payroll / Employee Hours. The one thing that G-Suite could not do for us, was manage our sales. We had to make the transition from using hand-written receipts to a digital POS. Simple hand-written items were resulting in many errors that cost us time and money.

Since implementing a POS system would have been a big change for us, and therefore required lots of research, I decided to try and solve our most basic problem using software. Since I started working as a manager, I began getting very familiar with using formulas within spreadsheet applications like Google Sheets and Excel. So, I used a spreadsheet in OpenOffice to create a digital representation of the receipts that employees were used to working with. I then did my best at independently researching the Java programming language, and I eventually wound up with a very basic program that could create, manage, and print these digital receipts. This allowed us to quickly print receipts and copies if needed. It also stored receipts digitally so that none could be lost.

The whole process of researching Java was a bitpainful but, but also rewarding and eye opening. It showed me how powerful even a simple app can be. The fact that I was able to come out with something useful also gave me hope that the idea of building an actual application isn't as inaccessible as I thought it would be. However, I knew that my methods of learning weren't the most efficient. I knew that in order to make something really useful, there was a lot more to learn. So that's when I started looking for a structured learning program and found FIS.

I've always pursued things that are challenging, and software development presents plenty of challenges. I enjoy solving problems, and I feel that software development fills that need! It extremely rewarding to me when I'm able to create a final product that is useful in some way.
