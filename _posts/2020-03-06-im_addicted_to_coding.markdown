I can't stop. I keep adding to my list of ideas, and I want to keep building them out. On the bright side, I've found something that I both enjoy and excel at. It's highly rewarding when you build something useful that works, and like other things that hit that reward center in your brain, it has become addictive.

I don't have an addictive personality. I've never had trouble with substances or anything like that. However the one thing that I have found is difficult to distance myself from is video games. I think that I'm addicted to challenges, or challenging things. Coding has been one of the most challenging things I have come across in my life, and the feeling of conquering a challenging problem is that much more rewarding.

For now, I'm running with it. I've set aside this time in my life to study full-time. I've previously attended another private school for audio engineering, and I was the same way. I enjoy getting really deep into a subject that I can focus all of my energy on. The difference with coding is that you are creating a product that can be highly usefule, and you are enabled to tap into sources of information and tie them together in a completely unique way.

I look forward to engaging in the software development community when I become more experienced, and can contribute useful pieces of code to larger projects. I hope to turn my addiction into a way that I can give back to the community by helping to develop useful things!
