It's the end of my sixth week at Flatiron. Here's a list of accomplishments so far:

- Gained proficiency in web design, greatly improved CSS/HTML skills
- Learned Ruby from the ground up
- Learned SQL from the ground up, and gained an understanding of the inner workings of a database
- Became proficient in both web scraping and API usage
- Built a CLI application to analyze various cryptocurrencies on the Bitcoin.com exchange
- Published a Ruby Gem to rubygems.org with a few hundred downloads at the time of writing this
- Built a Rails web application to manage data for my dog walking business

This would not be possible if I hadn't completed the course pre-work. Before entering the course, I had a goal of being able to work on projects that interest me alongside what I would be doing as required for the school. Because of this, I wanted to be as prepared as possible so that I could work on those projects, like managing my business. Little did I know, most people would not complete the prework. I thought it was mandatory. However, this was a good thing. Many of the labs we were completing in the first month were straight from the pre-work. I could quickly complete them, then do my personal reserach and build my own projects.

Luckily, going forward, I will be able to use the projects that I've started for the school's requirements, allowing me to improve them during my study time as well, which I am super excited to do.

Today is Jan 31st. Since December (November really, when I completed the pre-work), I have actually become a real programmer. I've made real programs with real uses and the capacity to expand into bigger programs. While I am still quite inexperienced, coming this far in such little time has definitely given me hope that I will be able to tackle larger problems.
