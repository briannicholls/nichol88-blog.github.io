Coding reminds me of music in many ways. I originally attended university for music performance. You develop a personal relationship with music, and, similarly, with code. It becomes a reflection of your personality.

After all, the music that you are performing was written and perfected many years ago, and interpreted by many great musicians before you. So, what you are bringing to the table?  *Your* interpretation of the piece. So it truly feels like you are putting your entire being up for judgement when you are performing. It can be very nerve-racking, and it's something tht all performing musicians need to overcome.

Because of this, you begin to hold yourself to high standards. Nobody wants to hear you flub a note in a Bach suite when they could just listen to Yo Yo Ma play it perfectly. So you practice. Which brings me to the biggest lesson I learned during my time in music school: the Power of Practice.

From the beginning of music school, professors (at least mine) would constantly beat you down. Proficiency exams would be given in the form of auditions in front of the entire music faculty, all sitting there and judging you. There simply is no substitute for practice in the world of music. If you didn't practice *relentlessly* in preparation for an audition or exam, it would be known. It doesn't matter how good you are at taking tests, or if you're a fast learner, but *did you practice enough?*

My piano instructor said to me once (I play the cello), "You string players are crazy. You don't even know what notes you are playing. You just throw your finger on the fingerboard and hope the note is in tune. Me, I just plop my finger on an F-sharp, and an F-sharp pops out. Your fifths better be perfectly in tune Mr. Nicholls, I will be listening!"

And you better believe I practiced playing my fifths in tune. 

This culture of instilling fear of failure was a huge motivator for me and others. Everyones biggest fear was forgetting their place during an audition, or something similar. But we learned what is possible. Just like my past two months at Flatiron school. 

The unfamiliar can seem almost impossible at first. Looking at unfamiliar code is *very* similar to opening a Beethoven Sonata for the first time. So much ink on the page! It's intimidating. But you break it down, look at it in chunks, and eventually things start to make a little bit of sense. An eventually, after a few weeks, you become proficient.

I'm doing things now with code that would have been completely out of sight before attending FIS. I have been reminded of the Power of Practice, persistence, and patience. We are capable of much more than we realize!
