Before attending FIS, I only had a small amount of coding experience. I managed a small business that heavily utilized Google's cloud services. Google Sheets and Forms can be particularly powerful, and through my research, I was able to utilize Forms to set up a Time Clock system that logged everyone's hours to a Google Sheets spreadsheet, in which they could view via a personal link to see their hours. This required a deep dive into Excel formulas, but also required a fair amount of JavaScript, which Google has a sepcial version of called Google Apps Script. Apps Script gives you default functionality for interacting with different Google apps, and honestly was not a bad way to get my feet wet in JavaScript, but as a newbie, it was mostly trial and error.

Once our company decided that we could not keep up with hand-written receipts, we decided we needed printers. So, we bought some receipt printers, but we did not yet have a POS to print receipts *from*. I learned that in applications like these, Java is dominant, and so in an effort to create something that worked with our printers, I decided I'd take a Java course. I learned a LOT in that class, and was able to build a simple app that could generate files from our spreadsheet and send jobs to the printer. It was a basic POS, and solved our main issue which was that it was taking too much time to hand-write every ticket. However, I did not feel confident in my abilities, because I struggled the whole way through it!

Then, I came to FIS, and started learning Ruby. At first, it was strange. So much white space! It looked like it was just a bunch of words with no separation. Of course, after studying it and learning that the words were written to make *more* sense of things, it started to click. In addition, the nature of Ruby helped me better learn the concepts and behind-the-scenes code that was also working, and I gained a much wider understanding than what I had with Java.

Now, I am on the third week of JavaScript. I just got through some challenging (I think) labs using `map()` and `reduce()`. Even though I've used these methods in Ruby, I found them much more difficult to implement in JS. Perhaps I'm still getting used to the JS syntax, mainly the function declarations/arguments. But now that I've completed the exercises, I feel like I have an even deeper understanding of the Ruby implementations as well. Learning how JS functions work has definitely made me realize the power of Ruby's blocks, Enumerables, and the function of `yield`. 

I'm grateful for the structure of the course and how the materials were introduced; it has been challenging but I feel every step that I've gained a much deeper knowledge because of how it relates to the previous material. JS has introduced many new language eccentricities, which have been the main focus of my transition to the language. Things like passing callback functions and using appropriate `return` statements have been th biggest challenge for me. For now, it's on to OO programming in JS!
